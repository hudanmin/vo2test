## Program description

Build an asteroid mining simulation, using react, express, node and a websocket server.

The simulation starts with 3 planets, 20 asteroids and 9 miners.

Each miner is assigned to a specific planet. A miner is a spacecraft which can travel from its planet to an asteroid, and mine its minerals.
Each miner has a mineral carry capacity, a travel speed and a mining speed. Miners start the simulation from their origin planet, will travel to an asteroid, mine minerals, and return back to their planet to drop the minerals.

A planet can store minerals. Each planet can spawn new miner when it has enough resources. It takes 1000 minerals to spawn a new miner, and the minerals are removed from the planet.

Each asteroid has a limited quantity of minerals, which decreases when it is mined by a miner, up to depletion. 
An asteroid can be mined by only one miner at a time.

The simulation is based on an event loop, 1 second in real life equals 1 year in the simulation.


## Rules

#### Map

- The map is a grid of 1000 * 1000. The position of the planets, asteroids and miners is contained within this grid.
- A position on the map is a `int` ranging from `0` to `999`.


#### Time

- One second (1000ms) in real life is 1 year in the simulation


#### Planet

- A planet can can store an infinite number of mineral.
- A planet can spawn a miner
- A planet has a position (`x`, `y`)


#### Miner

- A miner has 3 main characteristics:
	- `carryCapacity` (`int` from `1` to `200`), this is the maximum number of minerals a miner can carry at one time
	- `travelSpeed` (`int` from `1` to `200`), this is the travel speed per year of a miner when moving on the map
	- `miningSpeed` (`int` from `1` to `200`), this is the number of minerals a miner can mine per year
- A miner has a position (`x`, `y`)
- A miner belongs to a planet and can only transfer minerals to the planet is belongs to
- A miner has a maximum carry capacity (ie. `carryCapacity`). This is the maximum number of minerals it can carry at once
- A miner can travel:
	- A miner can travel between its planet and asteroids
    - A miner can move 
- A miner can mine an asteroid:
	- The miner needs to be at the same position as the asteroid to be able to mine it
    - The miner can mine a maximum of `miningSpeed` minerals per year (ie. if mining speed is 30, the miner will mine 30 minerals per year)


#### Asteroid

- An asteroid has a position (`x`, `y`)
- An asteroid has an amount of minerals (it starts with a random amount from `800` to `1200`)
- When a miner mines an asteroid, the amount of mined minerals is deducted from the amount stored in the asteroid


#### Mineral

- An amount of mineral is always an `int`




## Structure

The deliverable is a backend built using node.js, express.js and MongoDB (and other npm packages if needed), and a frontend built using React.
